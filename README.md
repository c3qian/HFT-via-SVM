# HFT-via-SVM
This repo contains my python replication for Kercheval et al. (2015)
For strategy backtesing, please go to SVM_strategy_backtesting.py; all other parts are in SVM_predict_accuracy_etc.py.

Due to uploading data size limitation, I did not upload the data I use. They are available as per request. 
Please contact c47qian@uwaterloo.ca.
